*** Advanced Demo ***

The Advanced Demo shows how you can drive a custom rig with custom controls programmatically, using the values returned from Live Server.

The LiveClientAdv.cs script is what drives the rig in the advanced demo. This script is heavily commented with examples showing how you can take animation values from Live Server and manipulate them to drive specific controls on your rig.

Example: Head Position
    // This one is a little tricky because we need to convert image space to scene space.
    // This is entirely dependent on the scale of your scene and how you want the character
    // to move around. 
    var headPos = GetControl("headPos");
    float xPos = headPos[0] / 50.0F;
    float yPos = headPos[1] / 50.0F;
    float zPos = headPos[2] / 75.0F;

    this.transform.FindDeepChild("def:sternumRoot").localPosition = new Vector3(xPos, yPos + 100, zPos);

For other examples, please review the LiveClientAdv.cs script:
